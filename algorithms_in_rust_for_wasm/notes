to test functions in lib.rs from main.rs 
    in Cargo.toml comment out crate-type = ["cdylib"] - this tries to compile to wasm 
    for local testing we want to compile in good ole rust 
    then you can do the normal cargo build + cargo run stuff

to build wasm 
    uncomment crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"] in Cargo.toml
    wasm-pack build --target bundler
    this produces our needed output in /pkg 

    


/config/paths 
    added 'wasm' to moduleFileExtensions
/config/webpack.config.js
    added 'wasm' to exclude line 550 


so fs is only server side reading of files - I need to read in the bytes of the wasm in 
    another way and then feed that to Webassembly.Module 
or I need to fetch it separately from the bundle?
